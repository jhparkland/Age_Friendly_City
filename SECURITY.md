or leaving your issue in the Issues section.
The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 24 hours, and will
send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in 
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security
team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and
full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or 
team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible to NPM.
