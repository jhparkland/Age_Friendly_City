At the same time as cities are growing, their share of older residents is increasing. To engage and assist cities to become more "age-friendly," the World Health 
Organization (WHO) prepared the Global Age-Friendly Cities Guide and a companion "Checklist of Essential Features of Age-Friendly Cities". In collaboration with
partners in 35 cities from developed and developing countries, WHO determined the features of age-friendly cities in eight domains of urban life: outdoor spaces and 
buildings; transportation; housing; social participation; respect and social inclusion; civic participation and employment; communication and information; and community 
support and health services. In 33 cities, partners conducted 158 focus groups with persons aged 60 years and older from lower- and middle-income areas of a locally
defined geographic area (n = 1,485). Additional focus groups were held in most sites with caregivers of older persons (n = 250 caregivers) and with service providers 
from the public, voluntary, and commercial sectors (n = 515). No systematic differences in focus group themes were noted between cities in developed and developing 
countries, although the positive, age-friendly features were more numerous in cities in developed countries. Physical accessibility, service proximity, security, 
affordability, and inclusiveness were important characteristics everywhere. Based on the recurring issues, a set of core features of an age-friendly city was identified.
The Global Age-Friendly Cities Guide and companion "Checklist of Essential Features of Age-Friendly Cities" released by WHO serve as reference for other communities to 
assess their age readiness and plan change.
